# Web Scraping and Data Projects – Python

This repository highlights applied Python work focused on **web scraping, Excel automation, and data analysis**.  
Projects show how I’ve used Python to gather real-world data, transform it, and prepare it for insights.

## Project Categories

### Web Scraping
- **bible/** — Scrapes Bible text into structured data for downstream NLP or analysis.  
- **covid/** — Parses public health tables into clean CSVs for reporting.  
- **movies/** — Collects titles, ratings, and genres for exploratory data analysis.  
- **tradingview/** — Pulls market price data for monitoring and trend analysis.

### Excel Automation
- **excel-automation/** — Moves data between Excel and Python: cleaning, transformation, and export.  
  Demonstrates ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflows.

### NFL Player Analysis
- **nfl-analysis/** — Data analysis project using a raw NFL players dataset (`NFL-players.csv`).  
  - Cleaned and prepared the dataset using pandas.  
  - Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to highlight player performance trends.  
  - Demonstrates structured analysis of real-world sports data with reproducible Python code.

### Miscellaneous
- **misc/** — Additional scripts and prototypes, including general data processing examples.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo or download a project folder.  
2. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Navigate to the desired folder and run: python scriptname.py
4. Outputs (CSV/Excel) are saved locally as defined in each script.

## Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**  
- Libraries: `pandas`, `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `lxml`, `openpyxl`

## Notes
- Web scraping projects respect site terms of service and are for **educational/portfolio use**.  
- The NFL project highlights data cleaning and analysis workflows without machine learning.
